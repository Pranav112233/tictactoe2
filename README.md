# tictactoe
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++. The game allows two players to take turns placing their markers (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their markers either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If the grid is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
